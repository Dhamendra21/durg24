        "description": "A team of scientists has discovered a new species of dinosaur in the Patagonia region of Argentina. The dinosaur, named Lavocatisaurus agrioensis, lived about 110 million years ago and belongs to the sauropod family, known for their long necks and tails. The discovery sheds new light on the evolution of sauropods and their distribution across the supercontinent of Gondwana. The team used 3D modeling techniques to reconstruct the dinosaur's skeleton, which was found in a remote area of the Neuqu√©n province. The discovery was published in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica.",
